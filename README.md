# NuCypher's Proxy Re-Encryption and Umbral


## USE CASE

**Proxy Re-Encryption** is an algorithm that allows a message encrypted for User A to be re-encrypted by a proxy so that User B can decrypt it. The fantastic thing about this algorithm is that the act of re-encrypting the message (with a **reencryption key** generated by User A) **never** allows the proxy to see the underlying message, just converts the ciphertextA to ciphertextB directly. This allows messages that are meant for User A, to be transferred and re-encrypted semi-automatically (through a Proxy - which does **not** see the underlying message) for User B without User A having to be online.

**The usual procedure is that User A would have to manually decrypt the ciphertextA with its secret key and encrypt again with User B's public key.**

The following image explains the mechanism that Proxy Re-Encryption uses:

**Umbral** works in basically the same way that Proxy Re-Encryption does, with the important difference that it **splits** the re-encryption key - generated by User A into N fragments, and to correctly decrypt the message, you have to recover at least M fragments (M <= N) - M is chosen at the moment you split the re-encryption key. Doing this, you don't have to trust a one single proxy, you split the responsibility between N proxys and only need M of them to respond with their corresponding fragment for User B to be able to correctly decrypt the message.
